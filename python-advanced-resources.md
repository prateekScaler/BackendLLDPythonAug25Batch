# Interactive Python-Deep‐Dive Resources

Below are tools and sandboxes you can *use*, not just read about.  
Each entry has a short description and a link to jump right in.

## 1. Visualise Python Execution & Memory

- [**Python Tutor – Visualise program execution**](https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html)  
  Step-through code with stack frames, heap objects, pointers/links. Great for seeing what Python really does under the hood.  [Python Tutor](https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- [**memory_graph (Python package)**](https://discuss.python.org/t/request-for-feedback-memory-graph-a-python-visualization-tool-for-education/78347)  
  A tool (still educational) to visualise memory & variable states of Python programs, especially useful in Jupyter.  [Discussions on Python.org](https://discuss.python.org/t/request-for-feedback-memory-graph-a-python-visualization-tool-for-education/78347?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- [**Pympler**](https://pympler.readthedocs.io/)  
  While not purely visual via web UI, this allows you to monitor object sizes, memory usage live – combine with notebook/plotting for interactive insight.  [Pympler](https://pympler.readthedocs.io/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## 2. Concurrency / Parallelism Interactive Sandbox

- [**Real Python – Speed Up Your Python Program With Concurrency**](https://realpython.com/python-concurrency/)  
  This includes interactive quizzes and sample code you can execute to see threads/processes/async in action.  [Real Python](https://realpython.com/python-concurrency/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- [**W3Resource – Python multithreading & concurrency exercises**](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/threading/index.php)  
  Has an editor and you can run scripts to test concurrency concepts.  [w3resource](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/threading/index.php?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## 3. Real-World Python / Django Sandboxes & Project-Playgrounds

- [**CodeSandbox – Project-Django sandbox**](https://codesandbox.io/s/project-django-uni-royhj)  
  An online playground where you can inspect a Django project live and edit to experiment.  [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/project-django-uni-royhj?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- [**HackMamba – Quickly Create Interactive Charts in Django (Plotly + Django)**](https://hackmamba.io/engineering/quickly-create-interactive-charts-in-django/)  
  A hands-on interactive tutorial that builds a Django + Plotly project you can fork and play with.  [Hackmamba](https://hackmamba.io/engineering/quickly-create-interactive-charts-in-django/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- [**VS Code Django Tutorial (interactive environment + debugging)**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/tutorial-django)  
  Although local, this guides you step-by-step with interactive code, debugging and template interplay.  [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/tutorial-django?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## 4. Design Patterns in Python – Interactive / Code‐Driven Catalogues

- [**Refactoring.Guru – Design Patterns in Python (catalogue with code examples)**](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/python)  
  Not a web canvas but very interactive in terms of code samples you can execute/modify.  [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/python?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- [**Python-Patterns.Guide**](https://python-patterns.guide/)  
  A site collecting patterns in executable Python; you can clone examples and run them to see how each pattern behaves.  [Python Patterns](https://python-patterns.guide/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
