When you start a new process:
1. Python imports the script in the new process
2. Without the guard, it will start ANOTHER ProcessPool
3. That pool will spawn MORE processes
4. Those processes import the script again
5. Infinite loop! üí•

The guard prevents this:
- In main process: __name__ == "__main__" ‚Üí True ‚Üí Runs code
- In child processes: __name__ == "script_name" ‚Üí False ‚Üí Skips code

RULE: Always use if __name__ == "__main__" with ProcessPoolExecutor!
